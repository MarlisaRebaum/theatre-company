## General Information
The task for this project was to practice using CSS Flexbox. For this project,
I was given a screenshot of a mockup of a theatre company website. The task was
to replicate the mockup using just HTML and CSS. Flexbox was used to display the
footer information in a row and the show dates in a column, with each show date 
being displayed in a row with an image, show details, and a button.

## Room for Improvement
Since the task for this project was to just create a replica of a provided screenshot,
the given task was completed successfully.

However, some improvements could be:
- Use CSS Flexbox not just to display rows and columns, but to make the site responsive.
- Make the map in the footer interactive so when clicked, the user is able to 
open Google maps to nativate to the theatre.
- Impove the layout of the footer - currently the links are not very aligned and
the spacing is uneven.
- Use a mailto: href for the email in the footer to allow users to send an email
by clicking the link.
- Make the "read more" buttons clickable and link to relevant information on the site.
